# Proof of Concept
At this time the only light client supporting such a protocol is [Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded)

The only server side node manufacturer supporting this protocol is [Nodl](https://www.nodl.it) (release is imminent)

Currently in talks with [myNode](http://mynodebtc.com) and Nicolas Dorier at [BTCPayServer](https://btcpayserver.org)
